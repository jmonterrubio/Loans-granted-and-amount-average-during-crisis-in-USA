# Loans granted and amount average during crisis in USA
## Summary

The financial crisis of 2007â€“09, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008-09 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Loans granted and its amount reflects how deep this crisis was. Given the loan data from Prosper we could see how the crisis evolved. In particular we'll see how some categorized loans (in this case Business, Vacation and Medical) evolved in number of loans and amount money requested from 2006 to 2013.

## Design

Firts of all is to become familiarized with the data doing some exploratory data analysis. With enough knowledge i can extract some ideas and scratch them.

My first try was to show how many loans was granted each year. For that purpose I thought in a simple bar chart, removing first and last year (2005 and 2014) because it doesn't have complete info about the year. The main idea was setted and it worked but i wanted to show more info and I added two more factors to the graph: the listing category and the amount average of the loan.

Too many listing categories could be shown so I just selected what I thought there were more significative: Business, Medical/Dental and Vacation. This graph (tagged as version 1) shows two data series, one with the bar chart of the number of loans granted by year and listing category and another one with the lines representing the evolution of the amount average of each year/category.

Asking for feedback I realized that my main concept was clear but some things must be updated to show what I actually want. I changed the bars and lines and create a new bubble plot with the same concepts. The main difference is that dissapears the two mixed plots and adds just one. This is a suggestion learned in the course when you want two show more than two variables in the same graph.
