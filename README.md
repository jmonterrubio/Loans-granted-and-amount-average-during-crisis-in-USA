# Loans granted and amount average during crisis in USA
## Summary

The financial crisis of 2007â€“09, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008-09 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Loans granted and its amount reflects how deep this crisis was. Given the loan data from Prosper we could see how the crisis evolved. In particular we'll see how some categorized loans (in this case Business, Vacation and Medical) evolved in number of loans and amount money requested from 2006 to 2013.

## Design

Firts of all is to become familiarized with the data doing some exploratory data analysis. With enough knowledge i can extract some ideas and scratch them.
